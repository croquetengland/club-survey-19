# General
## Respondents by Federation


```{r by-federation, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_clean %>% 
  count(`Your Federation`) %>% 
  adorn_totals
```

# Club membership

```{r total member histogram, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
